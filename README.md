## About BMW 4 Series

The BMW 4 Series is a range of compact luxury cars manufactured by BMW. Originally part of the 3 Series lineup, it was separated into its own series in 2013 to differentiate the sportier 2-door models from the more practical 3 Series sedans.

## Generations

- **First Generation (F32/F33/F36) (2013-2020)**: The first generation established the 4 Series as its own model line, featuring more aggressive styling and a wider stance compared to the 3 Series. Available in three body styles: coupé (F32), convertible (F33), and Gran Coupé (F36). Engine options ranged from the 420i to the high-performance M4, with both diesel and gasoline powertrains. The model received a facelift (LCI) in 2017 with updated exterior styling and interior improvements.

- **Second Generation (G22/G23/G26) (2020-present)**: Launched with a bold new design featuring the distinctive large vertical kidney grille. Available as a coupé (G22), convertible (G23), and Gran Coupé (G26). The new generation features improved aerodynamics, a stiffer chassis, and a range of mild-hybrid powertrains. Notable improvements include enhanced digital technology, driver assistance systems, and a more premium interior quality. Engine options include the 420i, 430i, and M440i, with the high-performance M4 sitting at the top of the range.
